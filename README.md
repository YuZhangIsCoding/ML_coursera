# Machine Learning

Today I started a classic Coursera course [Machine Learning by Andrew Ng](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/home/welcome). I will update weekly about the topics introduced in the lectures and interesting problems I encountered.
## Week 1
1. Introduction to Machine Learning
   * Arthur Sammuel:
    > Field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explictly programmed.
   * Tom Mitchell:
    > A computer is said to learn from experience E with respect to some task T and some performance measure P,
    if its performance on T, as measured by P, improves with experience E.
   * Popular ML algorithms:
      * Supervised learning
      * Unsupervised learning
      * Others: reinforcement learning, recommender systems
